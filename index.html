  <div id="intro">
    We designed a guide for those who are health-inspection conscious and interested in popular restaurants in NYC.
    In addition to providing a resource for people who want to choose a restaurant in one of our proposed categories,
    we wanted to analyze and identify if there were any correlations between average price level
    (based on Google Maps) vs. cuisine category (American, European, & Asian) , as well as the restaurant’s
     health score rated by the NYS Health Department and the number of Google reviews it has.

    Hypothesis 1: A restaurant's price point has an affect on its health score rating. The more expensive a restaurant,
    the higher the health score.
  </span>
</p>
  <p id="hypothesis">
  <span>
    Hypothesis 2: There is a correlation between cuisine type and its health score rating. We will see that certain types
    of cuisine tend to have higher health-scores.
  </span>
</p>
</div>
  <div id="intro">
    In our first visualization, the stacked barplot below displays the comparisons of the mean health score by cuisine
    type and average price of each sample restaurant from Google Maps. The bars are segmented by resteraunt category
    (i.e., the type of cuisine the restaurant serves). Our rationale for comparing these variables
    was based on the hypothesis that there might be a correlation between the mean health score and the average
    price for each restaurant - the higher the average price the restaurant sets, the higher the health score it will receive.
    We also assume that the restaurants who receive higher health scores by NYS Health Department are more likely to set up
    higher average prices as they regard themselves as “upscale” and “high-end service” restaurants.

  <span> Based on the three cuisine categories we determined, we divided them into specific types.
    Therefore, We randomly selected 50 Chinese and Korean restaurants in the Asian cuisine,
    50 New American restaurants in the American cuisine, and 50 French, Italian and Spanish restaurants
    in the European cuisine. However, though there is some data empty, we can still show the distribution
    of each restaurant regarding the price level based on the health score measured by the NYS health department.
    On the left axis, we show the price level from “$” to “$$$$” that is based on the information from Google Maps.
    On the bottom axis, we showed their health score distributions based on each specific cuisine.
    In addition, each color stands for a specific cuisine type. <br><br>Below are our findings:

    <ul class="bullet-points">
  <li>In this dataset, American restaurants are among the lowest health scores for each level of the average price.</li>
  <li>Chinese restaurants, though they receive relatively higher health scores than American’s, their average prices remain on the lower levels in this dataset. (only shown in “$” and “$$”)</li>
  <li>French restaurants receive relatively higher health scores than American’s, but at price level “$$”, we can tell that their scores rank higher than Chinese restaurants</li>
  <li>Italian restaurants from whom most of them receive health scores above 40, none of them sets up price at level 1 (“$”), yet they receive scores lower than Korean and Spanish.</li>
  <li>Spanish restaurants, though all of the restaurants selected in this dataset have received the highest health scores than any other selected cuisine types, they set up their average price in the lowest level (“$” and “$$”)</li>

</span>
<br>
<br>

Our hypothesis for the health score vs. google reviews correlation was that there would be a positive linear relationship between the two variables. Our assumption was that the more google reviews a restaurant had, the more prominent the restaurant was, which would hopefully correlate with a restaurant’s cleanliness rating by the NYS Health Department. 
<br> 
<br>

In this scatterplot, we compare the relationship between a restaurant’s health score and the number of Google reviews the establishment possesses on Google. As shown in the scatterplot, there is no relationship or correlation between the two variables. This means that in the future, if you’re looking for restaurants on google reviews and assume that the restaurant must be cleaner if there are many google reviews/people who seemingly visit the restaurant, you might be mistaken in thinking so.

<h3>Findings & Analysis</h3>
<div>

  To summarize, our main goal for creating this visualization was to tell a story involving the data 
  gathered from the New York State health department and various variables involving NY restaurants. 
  We reframed the dataset gathered and added additional inputs that we found interesting and created 
  visualizations that stemmed from that. 
<br>
<br>
Our visualizations produced three findings: There is a slight correlation between cuisine type and 
its health score rating. We see from the dataset that certain types of cuisine tend to have higher 
health-score ratings. This finding matched with one of our hypothesis that we created at the start
 of the project. The second finding that we observed notes that a restaurant’s price point does not 
 have an effect on its health score rating. While we initially believed that more expensive restaurants
  were less likely to receive health flags due to the “upscale nature” of pricey restaurants, it was
   interesting to find that it was not the case. Thus, it’s interesting to note that when you are 
   looking for a restaurant in NYC, just because the prices are higher and it seems “fancier,” 
   this doesn’t necessarily translate to a cleaner kitchen or fewer health citations!
